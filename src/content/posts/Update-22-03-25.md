Hi, I haven’t posted here since September last year… sorry about that. Life’s been pretty busy, but here’s a quick update on what I’ve been up to.

## Stepping Away from Game Development

I completed a concept demo for my game, and after that, I ended up taking a step back. I realized that while I *really* enjoy planning game concepts and have a massive appreciation for game devs, it’s just not the right path for me—at least not as a full-time pursuit.

That said, I still think it would be fun to make another game someday, purely as a hobby. But for now, I’m officially stepping away from game development.

## SpotifyNowPlaying

On a brighter note, **SpotifyNowPlaying** has been getting some love! I rewrote parts of the code, and now the site finally looks and works the way I imagined it from the very beginning. I'm really proud of how polished it’s become—it’s probably my favorite coding project so far.

Unfortunately, Spotify still hasn’t approved my request to release a public version hosted on my servers. So instead, I’ll be updating and rewriting the guide on the GitHub repo to help others self-host the project. If you’re even a little bit curious, please check it out—I’d love for more people to see it.

## What’s Next?

Honestly, I’m not completely sure yet. I’ve got a bunch of ideas brewing for new projects. I got a **3D printer** a few months ago and have been designing parts and little projects for friends and family—which has been super fun.

That said, school’s been intense lately, and I need to find a better balance between my workload and time for creative stuff. So even though I want to dive back into coding soon, it might take a little while to make that happen without letting my studies suffer.

## Still Here, Still Building

So yeah, I’m still here. I haven’t given up on this site or the projects I’ve shared here—I’m just moving at a slower pace for now. But I promise I’m still working in the background, and I’ll have more interesting things to share next time you hear from me.
