    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: March 23, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>NowPlaying ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our site and connect your Spotify account through our services.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>NowPlaying does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personal data. We use Spotify's authentication system to access limited playback data temporarily while you're using the site. Specifically, we request access to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently playing track information</li>
      <li>Playback state (e.g., play/pause, device status)</li>
      <li>Streaming capabilities (for display purposes only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used only to display your current playback status in the NowPlaying interface. No data is retained or stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Access Tokens</h2>
    <p>Spotify provides us with an access token during login. This token is stored in your browser’s local storage and is used only to enable functionality while you're on the site. It is not transmitted to any third-party servers or stored permanently.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We integrate with Spotify via the official <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api" target="_blank">Spotify Web API</a>. All data access is in accordance with Spotify’s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Account Disconnection</h2>
    <p>You may revoke NowPlaying’s access to your Spotify account at any time by visiting your <a href="https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/" target="_blank">Spotify Apps page</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We do not handle any sensitive user data or store information on external servers. Local storage in your browser is used solely to enhance functionality during your session.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. When changes are made, the “Effective Date” at the top of this page will be revised. You are encouraged to review this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
